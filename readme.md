## What happened?

This repository was originally created to fix issues and improve the Sector Alarm integration when upstream was inactive.
Those changes have now been merged into the upstream project, and maintenance has resumed there (with me as maintainer).

As a result, this fork is **archived and frozen**.

## Migration

If you installed this fork:

1. Remove this integration from HACS
2. Install the official integration:

3. Restart Home Assistant
